# OpenGLGameEngine

This is my first complex projects.

This is game engine, writing with C++ and OpenGL.

At this moment my engine can a little bit:

- It produces the scene with a few boxes on it. Each of the box has diffuse and specular color map. 
 The Walls and Floor has 2 maps too.
 - At the scene there are 3 point lights with different colors and direct light - the sun.
 - You can fly around the scene with usual keyboards W A S D SPACE Lft.Ctrl. ( forward, left, back, right, up, down).
 Shift will help you to go faster.
 - Around the scene there is a cubemap texture - skybox.
 -By pressing G button, you can see simple GUI image. The GUI system the main puprose for developing.
 - By pressing TAB you can make the mouse free and see how GUI works.
